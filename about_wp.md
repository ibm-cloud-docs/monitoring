# Identifying software vulnerabilities
{: #workoad-protection}

You can also use the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} service to find and prioritize software vulnerabilities, detect and respond to threats, and manage configurations, permissions and compliance from source to run.
{: shortdesc}

The ability to monitor software vulnerabilities is included when you use the [*Graduated Tier - Sysdig Secure + Monitor* service plan](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service_plans). This plan integrates {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} as part of {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}.

For more information, see the [{{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} documentation.](/docs/workload-protection)
