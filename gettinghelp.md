# Getting help and support
{: #gettinghelp}

If you have problems or questions when using the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}, you have several options to get help with determining the cause of the problem and finding a solution.

## Using the Support Center search field
{: #using-avatar}

You can use the Support Center search field to find answers to your questions from across the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} documentation and Stack Overflow forum. You can also manage support cases from the Support Center. You can find links to both the Stack Overflow forum for technical questions and the developerWorks (IBM Developer Answers) forum for all other questions under the Forums section of the Support Center.  

To access the Support Center, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Support** from the menu bar.  

If you have a basic, advanced, or premium [support plan](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans#support-plans), you can find call-in numbers and a chat option to get help.

The Support Center is the preferred method for getting support, but if you can't log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can use the [New support case](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/cases/add) page to submit a case.
