{: #eventnotif}

In the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service, you can configure single alerts and multi-condition alerts to notify support staff by email about problems that might require attention. Alerts can generate notifications to the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service to be handled as configured in that service.

{: tip}

To configure 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service to send notifications to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} to be sent to recipients by email, do the following:

## Step 1. Provision an {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance
{: #eventnotif-step1}

Provision an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance.](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-instance)

You can provision the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance in the same account or in a different account as the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance.

The number of events and filters that are available with {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} depends on the pricing plan selected.  Review the limitations statement when creating your {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance for [plan limitations](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external}.

## Step 2. Define authorizations
{: #eventnotif-step2}

Configure an authorization that grants {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} access to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}.

When both service instances are in the same account, choose 1 of the following options:

- Option 1: To grant the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **all resources**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **all resources**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

- Option 2: To grant an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

When both service instances are in the different accounts, define an authorization in the account that hosts the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Authorizations**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Select a source account.

    If the source service that needs access to the target service is in this account, select **This account**.

    If the source service that needs access to the target service is in a different account, select **Other account**. Then, enter the account ID of the source account.

4. Select {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} as the source service. Then, set the scope of the access to **All resources**.

5. Select {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} as the target service. Then, set the scope of the access to **All resources** or a single instance by configuring **Resources based on selected attributes** &gt; **Service Instance**.

    Other attributes are not supported for this type of authorization.

6. In the *Service Access* section, include both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

7. Click **Authorize**.

If you create an authorization between a service in another account and a target service in your current account, you need to have access only to the target resource. For the source account, you need only the account number.Â

## Step 3. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance
{: #eventnotif-step3}

1. [Configure a notification channel of type {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-source).

    When you configure the channel, a source, with the same name as your {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance name, is automatically added to your {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance. You can view it in the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} UI, in the *Sources* section.

2. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} topic](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-topic).

3. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-destination).

4. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription).

    For **Destination**, specify `IBM Cloud Email service`.
