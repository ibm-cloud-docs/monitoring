# Sending SMS alerts by using {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #eventnotif_sms}

In the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service, you can configure single alerts and multi-condition alerts to notify support staff by an SMS (Short Message Service) message about problems that might require attention. Alerts can generate notifications to the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service to be handled as configured in that service.
{: shortdesc}

[{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} is available in a limited number of regions](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints). Your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instances must be in the same region to communicate with one another.  Because of this, support for integration with {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} is limited to the regions where {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} is supported and where {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is also installed.

To configure 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service to send notifications to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} to be sent as an SMS message, do the following:

## Step 1. Provision an {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance
{: #eventnotif_sms_step1}

Provision an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance.](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-instance)

{: #eventnotif_sms_step2}

Configure an authorization that grants {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} access to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}. Choose 1 of the following options:

- Option 1: To grant the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **all resources**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **all resources**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

- Option 2: To grant an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

## Step 3. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance
{: #eventnotif_sms_step3}

1. [Configure a notification channel of type {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-source).

    When you configure the channel, a source, with the same name as your {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance instance name, is automatically added to your {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance. You can view it in the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} UI, in the *Sources* section.

2. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} topic](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-topic).

5. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-destination).

6. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription).
