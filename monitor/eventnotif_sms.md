Your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instances can send events to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instances in the same accoount and in other accounts. [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} is available in a limited number of regions](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints).

## Step 2. Define authorizations
{: #eventnotif_sms_step2}

Configure an authorization that grants {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} access to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}.

When both service instances are in the same account, choose 1 of the following options:

- Option 1: To grant the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **all resources**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **all resources**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

- Option 2: To grant an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service access to an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service, you must define an authorization where the **source service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; the **target service** is set to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} and **Resources based on selected attributes**; and the **service access** includes both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

When both service instances are in the different accounts, define an authorization in the account that hosts the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Authorizations**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Select a source account.

    If the source service that needs access to the target service is in this account, select **This account**.

    If the source service that needs access to the target service is in a different account, select **Other account**. Then, enter the account ID of the source account.

4. Select {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} as the source service. Then, set the scope of the access to **All resources**.

5. Select {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} as the target service. Then, set the scope of the access to **All resources** or a single instance by configuring **Resources based on selected attributes** &gt; **Service Instance**.

    Other attributes are not supported for this type of authorization.

6. In the *Service Access* section, include both *Reader* and *Event Source Manager* access.

7. Click **Authorize**.

If you create an authorization between a service in another account and a target service in your current account, you need to have access only to the target resource. For the source account, you need only the account number.Â

## Step 3. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance
{: #eventnotif_sms_step3}

1. [Configure a notification channel of type {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-source).

    When you configure the channel, a source, with the same name as your {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance instance name, is automatically added to your {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance. You can view it in the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} UI, in the *Sources* section.

2. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} topic](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-topic).

5. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-destination).

6. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription).
