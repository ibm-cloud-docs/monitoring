{: shortdesc}


## Configuring a notification channel
{: #notifications_create}

Complete the following steps to add a notification channel:

1. Launch the web UI. For more information on how to launch the Web UI, see [Navigating to the Web UI](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-launch#launch).

2. Click the **user icon**.  This is the icon with the initials of the logged on user.  Then click **Settings**.

3. Select **Notification Channels**.

4. Click **Add Notification Channel**.

5. Configure a notification channel:

    1. Select the type of notification, for example, `Webhook`.

    2. Enter the name of the channel.

    3. Enable the *Notify when Resolved* condition to receive a notification when the alert is manually resolved by a user.

    4. Enable the *Notify when Acknowledged* field to receive a notification when the alert is manually acknowledged by the user.

    5. Configure the notification according to the selected notification type:

        * For an **Email** notification channel, add the list of recipients, separated by commas.

        * For a **Slack** notification channel, add the URL of the *Slack channel*.

        * For **{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}** notification channel, specify the channel URL when you set up a IBM Cloud Function Channel. For more information, see [Configure IBM Cloud Function Channel](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/configure-ibm-cloud-functions-channel.html){: external}.

        * For a **Webhook** notification channel, add the *Webhook URL*. **Note:** When an alert is triggered, the notification is sent as a POST in JSON format to your webhook endpoint. For more information, see [Configuring a Webhook channel](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/configure-a-webhook-channel.html){: external}. For example, {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}can be integrated with ServiceNow using a custom webhook. To learn about configuring {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} with ServiceNow, see [Configure ServiceNow](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/configure-servicenow.html){: external}.

        * For a **VictorOps** notification channel, add the *API Key* and the *Routing Key*.

        * For an **OpsGenie** notification channel, add the *OpsGenie API key*. Notice that you must configure in OpsGenie the integration with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Add {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} Integration in Opsgenie](https://docs.opsgenie.com/v1.0/docs/sysdig-cloud-integration){: external}.

        * For a **Microsoft Teams** notification channel, add the *Microsoft Teams* URL.

        * For a **PagerDuty** notification channel, first you must authorize {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} to integrate with your account. When you select PagerDuty, a wizard to configure the integration with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} opens. Click either **Authorize Integration** or **Sign In Using Your Identity Provider** to authorize PagerDuty. Choose an existing service or set up a new service for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} notifications, then click **Finish Integration**. Select the escalation policy to use for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}  incidents. Then, on the *Notifications* tab, confirm your PagerDuty account, your service name, and the service key. For more information, see [Add {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} Integration in PagerDuty](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/administration-settings/notifications-management/set-up-notification-channels/pagerduty-notifications/){: external}.

            To retrieve the required permissions automatically by clicking **Auto-fetch**, first you must authorize {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} to integrate with your account. When you select PagerDuty, a wizard to configure the integration with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} opens. Click either **Sign in** or **Sign In Using Your Identity Provider** to authorize PagerDuty. Choose an existing service or set up a new service for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} notifications, then click **Finish Integration**. Select the escalation policy to use for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} incidents. Then, on the *Notifications* tab, confirm your PagerDuty *Account*, *Service Key*, and *Service Name*.

        * For a **Teams Email** notification channel, select the name of the team to receive notifications.

        * For an **IBM Event Notifications** channel you must first have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance configured.](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-instance)

            To configure the notification channel you need to specify the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance name and specify your choice of a channel name.  You will also indicate if the notification channel is enabled and when notifications should be sent, for example, when an alert is resolved. Notifications can be shared with one or all teams.

            Your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instances can send events to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instances in the same accoount and in other accounts. [{{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} is available in a limited number of regions](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints).
            {: important}
