# Managing alerts by using the Alerts API
{: #alert_api}

You can manage alerts in an {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} API.
{: shortdesc}

To learn how to use cURL, see [cURL command](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-mon-curl).


## Get details about a user alert
{: #alert-api-fetch-user-alert}

You can use the following cURL command to get information about an alert:


```text
curl -X GET <REST_API_ENDPOINT>/api/alerts/<ALERT_ID> -H "Authorization: $AUTH_TOKEN" -H "IBMInstanceID: $GUID" -H "TeamID: $TEAM_ID" -H "content-type: application/json"
```
{: codeblock}

Where

* `<REST_API_ENDPOINT>` indicates the endpoint targetted by the REST API call. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} REST API endpoints](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-endpoints#endpoints_rest_api). For example, the public endpoint for an instance that is available in us-south is the following: `https://us-south.monitoring.cloud.ibm.com/api`

* You can pass multiple headers by using `-H`.

    `Authorization` and `IBMInstanceID` are headers that are required for authentication.

    `TeamID` is optional. When you specify this header, you limit the request to the data and resources available for the team specified.

    To get an `AUTH_TOKEN` and the `GUID` see, [Headers for IAM Tokens](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-mon-curl#mon-curl-headers-iam).

* `<ALERT_ID>` defines the ID of the alert that you want to modify.


For example, the response body for an alert looks as follows:

```json
{
  "alert": {
    "autoCreated": false,
    "condition": "min(min(dallas_prod)) = 0",
    "createdOn": 1551358413000,
    "enabled": false,
    "id": 23211,
    "modifiedOn": 1551634372000,
    "name": "Monitoring Uptime Alert",
    "filter": "env in (\"prod\")",
    "notificationChannelIds": [
      4
    ],
    "segmentBy": [
      "host.hostname"
    ],
    "segmentCondition": {
      "type": "ANY"
    },
    "notificationCount": 60,
    "rateOfChange": false,
    "reNotify": false,
    "severity": 0,
    "severityLabel": "HIGH",
    "teamId": 493,
    "timespan": 60000000,
    "type": "MANUAL",
    "version": 9
  }
}
```
{: screen}


## Create an alert
{: #alert-api-create-alert}

You can use the following cURL command to create an alert:


```text
curl -X POST <REST_API_ENDPOINT>/api/alerts -H "Authorization: $AUTH_TOKEN" -H "IBMInstanceID: $GUID" -H "TeamID: $TEAM_ID" -H "content-type: application/json" -d @alert.json
```
{: codeblock}

Where

* `<REST_API_ENDPOINT>` indicates the endpoint targetted by the REST API call. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} REST API endpoints](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-endpoints#endpoints_rest_api). For example, the public endpoint for an instance that is available in us-south is the following: `https://us-south.monitoring.cloud.ibm.com/api`

* You can pass multiple headers by using `-H`.

    `Authorization` and `IBMInstanceID` are headers that are required for authentication.

    `TeamID` is optional. When you specify this header, you limit the request to the data and resources available for the team specified.

    To get an `AUTH_TOKEN` and the `GUID` see, [Headers for IAM Tokens](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-mon-curl#mon-curl-headers-iam).

* You can pass data to create the alert in the `alert.json` file by using `-d`.

    When you create an alert, include the following parameters: *type*, *name*,  *severity*, *timespan*, *condition*, *segmentby*, *segmentConditionn*, *filter*, *notificationChannelIds*, *enabled*

    For more information, see [Alert schema](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alert_api#alert-api-schema-req).


The following sample shows the request body parameters that you can set to create an alert:

```json
{
  "alert": {
    "version": null,
    "name": "My Alert!",
    "description": null,
    "teamId": null,
    "enabled": false,

    ],
    "segmentCondition": {
      "type": "ANY"
    },
    "severityLabel": "LOW"
  }
}
```
{: screen}



## Update an alert
{: #alert-api-update-alert}
