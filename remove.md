When you remove an instance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, consider the following information to tidy up:

1. Write down the list of sources that forward metrics to the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance that you want to remove. You must remove the agent from each source.
2. Remove permissions that are granted to users to work with the instance.

    If you use an access group to manage permissions to access the instance, you must remove the access group.

    If you use an access group to manage permissions to access different service instances, you must remove the policies that grant permissions to the instance that you want to remove.
