# Choosing an agent type by infrastructure
{: #agent-types}

To monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} service, you can deploy {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agents on supported hosts.
{: shortdesc}

## About agent types
{: #agent-types-ov}

You configure an agent by choosing an agent type.

The type of the agent determines the metrics that are collected automatically for a host. You can choose from an agent for orchestrated environments or an agent for non-orchestrated environments. For more information, see [Collecting default metrics by using the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-collect-metrics#about-collect-metrics-2).

If you have connected an instance of {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} to your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance, the agent will provide data to both services without having to configure two separate agents. For more information about connecting the services, see [Can {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full_notm}} be used together?](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-faq#faq_4)
