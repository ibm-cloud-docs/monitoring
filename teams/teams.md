# Working with teams
{: #teams}

You can use teams to add another dimension of control on the data that is available through a monitoring instance in addition to platform and service access controls. A user with the **manager** service access role for an {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance can create, delete, add members, and change the scope of teams in that instance. Once a team is created, an admin can add a user to it through {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM).
{: shortdesc}

In the world of microservices, it is becoming harder to track down valuable metrics and ensure that no sensitive data is exposed. By using teams, administrators can apply a fine grain control on resources. Consider the following information when you work with teams:
* You can create 1 or more teams in a monitoring instance.
* You can specify what resources and metrics are visible for users that are granted IAM permissions to work in the team.
* You can enhance the users experience by customizing the initial dashboard that users in a team get when they launch the web UI.

These instructions assume that you have provisioned a monitoring service instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: note}


## Assigning a user to a team
{: #teams_assign}

To add a user to a team, complete the following steps:
1. Check that you have the **administrator** platform role to work with the monitoring service or with a specific instance.
2. Define a team level IAM policy for the user. For more information, see [Granting permissions to work in a team](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-iam_grant_team).

When the policy is defined, the user is added to the list of users that have access to work with resources configured for a team.


## Creating a team
{: #teams_create}

You must have **manager** role to create a team in a monitoring instance.

An administrator or a manager of an {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance must switch to the *Monitor Operations* team before he can create teams and manage existing teams.

        If the parameter is set to *Container*, members can see only Container-level information.

    * Set the **Scope** to limit what data users can see. You can set one or more conditions by specifying expressions for metrics.

        By default, the scope is set to *everywhere*.

    * [Optional] Enable or disable **Sysdig captures**. Check this box to allow this team to take {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} captures.

        Capture files will only be visible to members of this team.

        Captures include detailed information from every container on a host, regardless of the teamâ€™s scope.

    * [Optional] Enable or disable **Infrastructure Events**. Check this box to allow members to view all custom infrastructure events from every user and monitoring agent. When is not checked, users can see infrastructure events that are sent specifically to this team.
